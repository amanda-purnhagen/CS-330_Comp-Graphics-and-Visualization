# CS-330_OpenGL
This is my final project for my Computational Graphics and Visualization course. I used C++ and OpenGL to render a 3D scene with textures and lighting.

## How do I approach designing software?
The way I approach designing software involves understanding the reading material to the best of my ability before having the opportunity to put that knowledge to use. Then I source certain functionalities and general framework from any provided starter code. Next, I work in a modular fashion by making small changes to the code, building the code, and running the program to make sure each change has the intended outcome. In that way, I can quickly pinpoint and undo unsuccessful changes.

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
My work on this project has helped me better understand how to design in a 3D space. I became fluent in 3D coordinates and basic matrix manipulation. This project also pushed me to learn what is happening behind the scenes so I can make the proper changes far more efficiently. Additionally, I now understand how to provide textures and lighting to objects in a 3D space using OpenGL.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
My design process included sourcing code from multiple projects that were provided for reference such as the module tutorials, the CylinderExample project, and the MultipleObjectsExample project. I took what I needed from each and troubleshooted the compatibility of the includes and libraries. This helped me create a proper starting template. From there, I referenced my 2D photo that I intended to recreate and started making small changes to the code to reflect the scene in the photo. Also, my projects for earlier modules contributed to my final project a lot. For example, I had already created a scene that included two lights, a plane, and my composite object (a pencil made from a cylinder and a pyramid), so I copied that object data into my final project and continued building from there.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
After completing this project, I feel far more prepared to accomplish the goals I will set in my future work. Certain parts of this project strongly encouraged me to be patient and determined. I will remember how I overcame obstacles in this project so I can continue to draw upon my creativity and logic to come up with innovative solutions.

## How do I approach developing programs?
The way I approach developing programs is to think outside the box without trying to reinvent the wheel. I always use provided resources to my advantage by working within the existing framework to accomplish what I need to. I work in a modular fashion to avoid building on top of an existing error. I always keep the assignment prompt in mind to make sure I am staying with the scope of the project and hitting all the marks.

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
While working on my 3D scene, I improved my eyesight for precision. While creating a 3D scene, small details can make a big difference. One mistake can give the same texture to every 3D object. This project was an exceptional lesson in patience and attention to detail. I had to be very intentional with my use of commands.

### How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was a crucial factor in my development. I built and ran my code after almost every small change. This allowed me to see my work progress in real time and catch mistakes quickly. Creating code on top of an existing mistake is a classic way to waste a lot of resources. It is far more worth it to build and run the code often so any mistakes can be undone immediately.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Throughout the milestones in this course, my code has evolved from changing the float values of a 2D triangle's vertices, to creating a 3D square pyramid and using a shader to add custom colors, to customizing camera movement, to adding textures and lighting, to completing the 3D scene for my final project. My approach needed to evolve with the assignments. Each module required me to think about a larger scope. It was helpful to start small, but now I understand how many parts of OpenGL code work together and am far more confident creating entire 3D scenes.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My career goal is to build efficient, user-friendly software for an organization that helps those in need. Computer science can help me to reach that goal by providing me the proper tools in my toolbelt. I need to be properly equipped with foundational knowledge to build products that allow an organization to reach humanitarian goals.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations give me the knowledge and skills I need to model my future prototypes in 2D or 3D using OpenGL. It is exciting to know I now have the ability to visualize my ideas. In my future courses, if I am working on a graphical or physical design and need to understand it spatially, I can problem solve using a 3D rendering.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Similarly, computational graphics and visualizations give me knowledge and skills that can be applied in my future professional pathway. I am excited at the prospect of using OpenGL or other graphical APIs to immediately visualize what I am working on, whether it is a virtual 3D scene or model, stereolithography files, or the first draft of a product prototype. It will be a great way limit the use of resources and still test the viability of ideas.
